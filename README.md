# ENS Test

[Live Example](https://flyswatter.github.io/ens-test/)

Dan's first grappling with the [ethereum-ens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethereum-ens) JS package.

It's not working quite like I expected, so this is for asking questions with.

The attempt in question can be found in [index.js](./index.js).

## Viewing locally

- run a local http server in this folder.
- Open the `index.html` page.

## Editing locally

- Have node.js installed.
- `npm install` in this folder.
- After making changes to `index.js`, rebuild with `npm run build`.
